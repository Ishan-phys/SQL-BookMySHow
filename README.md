## üß±Ô∏è Database Schema

### 1. `Theatre`

* `theatre_id` (PK)
* `name`
* `location`

### 2. `Screen`

* `screen_id` (PK)
* `theatre_id` (FK)
* `seats`

### 3. `Movie`

* `movie_id` (PK)
* `title`, `language`, `duration`, `genre`, `certificate_rating`

### 4. `Show`

* `movie_id` (FK)
* `show_date`, `start_time`


## Fetching all shows running for a movie on a given date

### 1. Find the `show_id` for a movie, screen, and date:

```sql
SELECT s.show_id
FROM `Show` s
JOIN Movie m ON s.movie_id = m.movie_id
JOIN Screen sc ON s.screen_id = sc.screen_id
JOIN Theatre t ON sc.theatre_id = t.theatre_id
WHERE m.title = 'Rambo'
  AND t.name = 'PVR Inox'
  AND s.show_date = '2025-05-24'
  AND s.start_time = '10:30:00';
```
